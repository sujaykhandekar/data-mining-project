# data-mining-project
This is my Data mining course project and the things that I tried in it. As a part of our final project we were part of in-class Kaggle competition in which we had to predict airbnb lisiting booking rate (0=low, 1=high) from 66 other independent variables. We ended up winning the competition with AUC of 95.44. This repository has all the work I did or tried in the project.

airbnbFeatureEngineering1 has preprocessing of amenities and host since columns. dummy column is created for each of the amenity

airbnbFeatureEngineering2 has preprocessing of all the other columns along with handling of missing values.

airbnbFeatureEngineering3 has topic modeling on description column using LDA.
